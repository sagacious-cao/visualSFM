# visualSFM
use pmvs/cmvs from pmoulon on github https://github.com/pmoulon/CMVS-PMVS.git
follow the instructions there to compile
should notice that outputlinux folder should be created in program/ rather than program/main when doing cmake
otherwise tinycthread won't be included and thus leads to compiling errors

the other third party programs can be compiled correctly by following Scott Sawyer's tutorial http://www.10flow.com/2012/08/15/building-visualsfm-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin-desktop-64-bit/
